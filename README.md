# SmartHydroponics
Arduino project utilizing barometric pressure sensors to create a "smart" hydroponic airstone pump that easily adds smart features to other dumb containers. This includes plant health monitoring and detailed data logging.

Features include:

OLED display showing runtime, fluid level, temperature, and days left until refill.
Fluid level monitoring
Quick and easy one-button calibration to adapt to [any?] container
Days remaining until refill calculations based on real-time ensor data and actual plant consumption rate
Daily fluid consumption rate calculations
Plant growth/health data inferred via liquid uptake measurement
Detailed Hourly/Daily data logging to SD card

Components Required:

2x Arduino Nano
OLED JMDO.96C
